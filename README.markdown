# Sign Langauge to Text Conversion

This is our college project in the Machine Learning course at IIIT Delhi. The goal of the project is to convertÂ American sign language (ASL) to corresponding English Alphabets in real time.
We evaluated numerous Machine Learning techniques for the task and achieved 95% accuracy with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
